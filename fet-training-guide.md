# Workplace Fairness Legislation
### Key Changes from Tripartite Committee Recommendations

## Historic Development
In **August 2023**, the Singapore government accepted recommendations from the Tripartite Committee on Workplace Fairness to enact comprehensive workplace fairness legislation.

## Three Pillars of the Legislation

### 1. Protect Workers
- Prohibit common forms of workplace discrimination
- Ensure fair treatment at all stages of employment
- Protect against retaliation for reporting discrimination

### 2. Preserve Workplace Harmony
- Emphasize mediation and grievance handling
- Legal action only as a last resort
- Focus on education and relationship repair

### 3. Support Business Growth
- Fair employers benefit from:
  - More productive workforce
  - Better talent attraction
  - Higher employee retention
  - Enhanced company reputation

## Important Note
The legislation works **together** with TGFEP (Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices) to create a comprehensive framework for workplace fairness.

# Dismissals & Retrenchment
### Fair and Responsible Practices

## Understanding Dismissals

### Valid Reasons for Dismissal
| Reason | Examples | Requirements |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Misconduct** | Theft, violence, serious policy breach | Due inquiry, evidence, chance to explain |
| **Poor Performance** | Consistent failure to meet standards | Warnings, improvement plan, documentation |

### Wrongful Dismissal Includes
- Discrimination based on protected characteristics
- Retaliation for exercising employment rights
- To avoid paying benefits or entitlements
- Forced resignation under duress

## Responsible Retrenchment

### Key Principle
> **Retrenchment should be the LAST RESORT after all alternatives are exhausted**

### Alternatives to Consider First
1. **Temporary Measures**: Shorter work week, temporary pay cuts
2. **Redeployment**: Transfer to other departments/roles
3. **Reskilling**: Train for different positions
4. **Voluntary Separation**: With appropriate packages
5. **Hiring Freeze**: Natural attrition

### If Retrenchment is Necessary

**Selection Criteria Must Be:**
- Objective and documented
- Consistently applied
- Based on business needs
- Non-discriminatory

**Support for Affected Employees:**
- Fair retrenchment benefits (per TAMEM guidelines)
